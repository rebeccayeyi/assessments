# Consider how a yelp site is organized
# We need customers, restaurants, owners, and reviews.  How do they link up?

# As a first step
# Please write out the domain model on this file
# What we are concerned about is which tables have foreign keys
# Don't stress: There may be multiple correct answers based on your conception of the problem.

# Eg. for our books and authors your deliverable would look like

# books
id | title | author_id

# author
id | name |

# Hints:
# - The data always lives on the belongs to relationship
# - Do the belongs_to first
# - Then do the has_many
# - If there is a many to many, we need a third table

customers -- has many reviews, has many restaurants through reviews
restaurants -- has many reviews, has many customers through reviews
owners -- has many restaurants, has many customers, has many reviews
reviews -- belongs to a customer, belongs to a restaurant



# reviews
id | customer_id | restaurant_id
